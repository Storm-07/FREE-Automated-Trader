# FREE Tradingview Automated Trader
made by: Storm-07
  I came up with a way to brute force automate trades on tradingview without signing up for a membership using macros and webhooks.
There are a few services you may need to sign up for first if you don't already have accounts but do not worry because these are also free unless you'd like to make more than 50 trades per day. 

Service #1: Tradingview
  This one is fairly self explanatory as it is the platform we will be using to make trades. IMPORTANT NOTE: For this automated trader, you must have a dedicated computer open for as long as you intend to make trades for. This computer will be the only one allowed to have a tradingview window open because free accounts are only allowed to have one window open at a time.

Service #2: Visual Studio Code
  You will very likely have to have this code editor installed in order to edit your macros unless you share the same type of PC as me. Do not worry if you are not experienced with programming, a simple google search or youtube video will help with any issues setting up your macro.

Service #3: Pipedream.com
  Ignoring the name, this site will act as the webhook that receives tradingview email alerts and sends a trigger to your server in order to activate the buying and selling macros.

Service #4: ngrok
  This is another free pipeline service that will allow the pipedream webhook to connect with your flask server.

Service #5: AutoHotKey
  You might not actually have to sign up for this but this will be the language(?) that we use to setup the macros. If you are not familiar with macros, they are simply a string of user inputs that execute different operations. For example we could set shift + G to left click on the corner of your screen.

# STEPS FOR AUTOMATION
1. Download Visual Studio Code, Download AutoHotKey, Download ngrok
2. Create a new workflow in pipedream using an email as the trigger, then add a step called "Send any HTTP Request" then change the "GET" type request to "POST", ignore the URL for now as we will create that later, then go into headers and add a header name of "content-type" and add the corresponding header type to "application/json". Then in the body section set the content type to "application/json" and change the key to "plain-text-body" and the value to "{{steps.trigger.event.body.text}}". What all this does is access the email we will receive from out tradingview email alert and extract the word either "buy" or "sell" in order to send to the server.
3. Go into your profile settings in tradingview, in the privacy settings change the SMS email to the random email generated by the pipedream trigger in the first step of your workflow. it should looks something like: "[randomchars]@upload.pipedream.net". So when tradingview receives an alert from an indicator or strategy (as long as it says either "buy" or "sell" in the alert instructions) the alert will trigger your workflow.
